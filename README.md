Introduction

Maze solving is a classic problem in computer science, and this project demonstrates how to solve mazes using a Java implementation. The program uses a well-known maze-solving algorithm to find a path from the entrance to the exit of the maze.



Features

- Input maze reading from text files.
- Solving mazes using a chosen algorithm.
- Visualization of the solved path on the maze.
- Command-line interface for easy interaction.


Algorithm

The project currently uses the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to solve mazes. This algorithm explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Feel free to contribute and implement other maze-solving algorithms as well.
